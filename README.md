## Background

I was looking into [Nat Friedman's homepage](https://nat.org/) about 5 months ago and read a really trivial yet astonishing statement: "A week is 2% of the year".

Everyone knows that time is precious. But it's really not that tangible when you're stuck in the absolute scale of a clock. 

Instead, using relative scales is far more effective for humans, at least that is what I propose.

I really fell in love Nat's concept of "a week is 2% of the year" and have been adopting this to measure my life.

## Why use this?

You might wonder, 'Why not use existing apps in the market?'. 

However, my research suggested that many existing applications charge excessively for minimal utility.

So, that is why I decided to build it myself and turns out it was the right choice.

Most of all, it's free!

## Why is it free?

I initially considered pricing it, but given my involvement in other businesses, I preferred not to deal with the hassle. Moreover, I wanted to contribute to enhancing productivity freely.

P.S. People loved it when I shared it on my LinkedIn ♥️

## Why are you open sourcing it?

Because I believe there are many people out there who can improve my work and complete tasks I haven't started yet.
