## Background

I was looking into [Nat Friedman's homepage](https://nat.org/) about 5 months ago and read a really trivial yet astonishing statement: "A week is 2% of the year".

Everyone knows that time is precious. But it's really not that tangible when you're stuck in absolute scale via clock. 

Instead, using relative scales are far more effective to humans, at least that is what I am proposing.

I really fell in love's Nat's concept of "a week is 2% of the year" and have been adopting this to measure my life. 

## Why use this?

You might wonder, 'Hey, there seems to be existing apps in the market. Why don't you use those?'. 

Well, I might not have done enough research but I found that many of the existing applications were charging way too much for such minimal utility.

So, that is why I decided to build it myself and turns out it was the right choice.

Most of all, it's free!

## Why is it free?

Well, I initially wanted to price it, but I have other businesses going on and don't want to hassle too much with it.

Also, I want people to become more productive and this seems to be a tiny contribution that I can actually make to help the world :)

P.S. People loved it when I shared it on my LinkedIn ♥️
